The inspiration for cf3ruby is [contextfreeart][] and the jashkenas [original][], so what is context free art?

Chris Coyne created a small language for design grammars called CFDG. These grammars are sets of non-deterministic rules to produce images. The images are surprisingly beautiful, often from very simple grammars.
In the original version there were 3 terminals of a TRIANGLE, SQUARE and CIRCLE see cfdg [how_to][].
